# Appcket Helm Chart

Appcket is an advanced starter kit designed to help you quickly get a microservices-based web application running on a Kubernetes cluster.

This Helm chart contains everything you need to deploy to your own K8s cluster in any environment (ex: local development laptop, QA, Production).

Please see the [Appcket Documentation website](https://docs.appcket.org) for more information on how to configure and use this Helm chart.
